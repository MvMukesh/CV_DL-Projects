# Computer Vision-Deep Learning - Projects
OpenCV projects, step towards Computer Vision and Deep Learning <br>
This repository includes any projects that I have completed in research, projects. <br>
`Main focus is to study fields that cross over Machine Learning(SVM, K-means), Deep Learning(CNN), Computer Vision and Data Science`

#### Computer Vision & OpenCV - Basics
Image processing ==> blurring image, understanding image morphology, geometric transforms, image histograms

|             |          |           |
|-------------|----------|-----------|
|OpenCV Basic | | displaying image <br> plt.imshow(cv2.cvtColor(input, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB))|
|Grayscaling | |very popular technique in computer vision used to find <br>`gradient on edge points of an image` |
|Colors HSV-Hue | |in HSV it is more easier to represent a color than in BGR color-space <br> first convert BGR image to HSV `HSV is used to extract a colored object`|
|Colors Gray-RGB | |OpenCV allow to convert an RGB image into Grayscale in two ways <br> 1. using cvtColor function <br> 2. using imread function |
|Color Red-Green-Blue | |machine can only understand three colors: red, green, blue <br> here will tweek color intensity in RGB |
|Histogram | | helps to understand distribution behind colors of an image <br> important to know when you plan on compiling a ML algorithm with balanced dataset|
|Drawings of Shapes | | ever need to have shapes to interact with computer vision world like object detection, it's common to create digital shapes to represent them|
